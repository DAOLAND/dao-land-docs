# DAO LAND — Roadmap v1

## Overview

DAO LAND follows a structured, phased roadmap designed to build long-term value through land utility, controlled expansion, and governance alignment.

The roadmap is intentionally adaptive. Each phase is activated based on ecosystem readiness, infrastructure stability, and real demand — not artificial deadlines.

DAO LAND prioritizes execution, structure, and sustainability over rapid expansion.

---

## Phase 1 — Genesis Foundation (Current)

**Objective:** Establish DAO LAND as a real, verifiable, and structurally sound land-based ecosystem.

### Deliverables

- Creation of the Genesis LAND collection (50 total)
- Initial mint of the first 10 Genesis LANDs
- Deployment on Solana using Metaplex Core (compressed NFTs)
- IPFS-based metadata and asset storage
- Release of official documentation:
  - Whitepaper v1
  - Roadmap v1
  - Legal Disclaimer
- Project identity and positioning setup

### Outcome

DAO LAND is established as a legitimate, transparent project with a limited Genesis supply and a clear long-term vision.

---

## Phase 2 — Community & Utility Design

**Objective:** Align LAND holders with ecosystem direction and prepare utility frameworks.

### Deliverables

- Activation of official communication channels
- Genesis LAND holder recognition
- Definition of LAND utility models
- Design of LAND participation and access systems
- Preparation for LAND-based activation mechanics

### Outcome

LAND ownership begins to represent active positioning within the DAO LAND ecosystem.

---

## Phase 3 — LAND Utility Activation

**Objective:** Activate real use cases for DAO LAND NFTs.

### Deliverables

- Activation of LAND access mechanics
- Early LAND utility features
- Priority systems for Genesis LAND holders
- LAND-based participation opportunities
- Initial governance discussion frameworks

### Outcome

LANDs transition from static assets into functional positions inside the ecosystem.

---

## Phase 4 — LAND Rental & Allocation Systems

**Objective:** Enable LANDs to generate value through usage rather than speculation.

### Deliverables

- Design of LAND rental or allocation mechanisms
- Temporary LAND usage rights for participants
- LAND assignment to builders, contributors, or initiatives
- Utility without requiring permanent ownership transfer

### Outcome

DAO LAND introduces demand-driven economic activity tied to LAND usage.

---

## Phase 5 — Ecosystem Expansion (250 LANDs)

**Objective:** Expand the ecosystem while preserving scarcity and value.

### Deliverables

- Gradual expansion beyond Genesis toward 250 total LANDs
- Controlled release of new LAND districts
- Continued priority advantages for Genesis LAND holders
- Expansion of LAND utility scope

### Outcome

DAO LAND evolves into a multi-district ecosystem while maintaining Genesis significance.

---

## Phase 6 — Governance Activation

**Objective:** Transition DAO LAND toward decentralized governance.

### Deliverables

- Governance framework activation
- LAND-based proposal and voting systems
- Community-driven decision-making
- Governance over ecosystem expansion and utility

### Outcome

DAO LAND becomes a LAND-governed ecosystem shaped by long-term participants.

---

## Phase 7 — Long-Term Scale (1,000 LANDs)

**Objective:** Mature DAO LAND into a scalable, sustainable framework.

### Deliverables

- Expansion toward 1,000 LANDs over time
- Advanced LAND utility systems
- Long-term sustainability initiatives
- Ecosystem integrations
- Continued evolution through governance

### Outcome

DAO LAND reaches full ecosystem maturity where LAND ownership represents strategic positioning.

---

## Roadmap Philosophy

DAO LAND follows three core principles:

1. Scarcity before scale  
2. Utility before hype  
3. Structure before expansion  

Each phase builds intentionally on the previous one.
