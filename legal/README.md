# DAO LAND — Legal Disclaimer

## Important Notice

DAO LAND is a decentralized digital land ecosystem built on the Solana blockchain. DAO LAND “LANDs” are non-fungible digital assets designed to provide access, participation rights, governance alignment, and potential ecosystem-related utility over time.

DAO LAND LANDs do not represent equity, shares, securities, financial instruments, or ownership in any legal entity. Ownership of a DAO LAND does not grant legal ownership of physical or virtual real estate.

DAO LAND is an evolving project released in controlled phases. Features, utilities, and governance mechanisms may change as the ecosystem develops.
