# DAO LAND

**DAO LAND** is a structured digital land ecosystem built on the Solana blockchain.

It introduces a phased approach to digital land ownership where each land represents
a position within an evolving ecosystem — designed for access, participation,
and long-term utility rather than short-term speculation.

DAO LAND is built with intention:
- Small initial supply
- Controlled expansion
- Utility-driven land activation
- Governance alignment over time

This repository contains the **official documentation** for the DAO LAND project
and serves as the single source of truth for its Genesis phase.

No phase is rushed. Every activation is intentional.
