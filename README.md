# DAO LAND

**DAO LAND** is a land-based NFT ecosystem built on Solana, designed to introduce structured digital land ownership, participation, and long-term value generation through governance, utility, and ecosystem alignment.

DAO LAND is not a speculative NFT drop. It is a **phased, utility-driven land framework** designed to grow sustainably over time.

## 🌍 What Is DAO LAND?

DAO LAND is a collection of on-chain LAND units represented as NFTs. Each LAND functions as a **position within a broader ecosystem**, unlocking access, governance participation, and future land-based utility.

LANDs are released in controlled phases to preserve scarcity, alignment, and long-term value.

## 🧱 Genesis Phase

- **Genesis Supply:** 50 LANDs  
- **Minted Initially:** 10 LANDs  
- **District:** Alpha (Genesis District)

Genesis LAND holders form the foundational layer of the DAO LAND ecosystem and retain priority access to future expansions, governance, and utility activation.

## ⚙️ Core Principles

- Scarcity before scale  
- Utility before hype  
- Governance before expansion  
- Long-term value over short-term speculation  

DAO LAND is built with intention, structure, and discipline.
